## What It Does

DiceBot logs into your Dice.com account, cycles through keywords you control, and clicks **Easy Apply** on every matching job — fully automated. It tracks every application in a CSV so it never applies to the same job twice, then puts itself to sleep at 2 AM and wakes back up at 3 AM without you touching a thing.

**Who it's for:**
- C2C contractors on the bench who need mass vendor visibility fast
- Bench sales recruiters managing candidate pipelines on Dice
- Independent IT consultants who want inbound vendor calls, not cold outreach

## Results (Real Run: April 14–23, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total applications submitted | **8,202** |
| Success rate | **99.76%** |
| Failed applications | 10 |
| Bot detections / CAPTCHAs | **0** |
| Average per day | ~250–300 |
| Run duration | 10 days, unattended |

> ⚠️ **Stay under 300 apps/day.** The bot enforces this by default via `BATCH_SIZE` and `BATCH_BREAK_MINUTES` in `config.py`.

## Quick Start

> **First time? Read [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) for Windows + macOS step-by-step walkthrough.**

```bash
# 1. Clone and install (≈ 2 min)
git clone https://github.com/trinathone/rezloft.git
cd rezloft
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# 2. Setup wizard — sets your Dice credentials + keywords + speed
python3 setup.py

# 3. Run
python3 dice_bot.py
```

The bot opens a browser, logs in, and starts applying. Applications are logged to `applications.csv` in real time.

---

## Configuration

### `keywords.txt` — what to search

One keyword per line. The bot cycles them in order, moving to the next when the current keyword is exhausted.

```
# keywords.txt
Python Developer
AWS Solutions Architect
Data Engineer
DevOps Engineer
Java Developer
```

Copy `keywords.example.txt` as your starting point — 20 common IT/C2C terms included.

### `.env` — credentials

Created automatically by `python3 setup.py`. You can also edit it manually:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DICE_EMAIL` | ✅ | Your Dice.com login email |
| `DICE_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Your Dice.com password |
| `PROXY` | ❌ | Optional SOCKS5/HTTP proxy |
| `DEBUG` | ❌ | `true` for verbose logging |

### `config.py` — speed & filters

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `EASY_APPLY_ONLY` | `True` | Only Easy Apply jobs |
| `JOB_TYPES` | `['fulltime']` | `'contract'` or `'fulltime'` |
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | `False` | Remote jobs only |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `(80, 100)` | Apps per batch before a break |
| `BATCH_BREAK_MINUTES` | `(2, 3)` | Break length between batches |
| `SLEEP_HOUR_START` | `2` | Bot sleeps after this hour |
| `SLEEP_HOUR_END` | `3` | Bot wakes at this hour |
| `HEADLESS` | `False` | Set `True` for server deploys |

## Run 24/7 for Free (Oracle Cloud)

[Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) gives you a permanently free ARM VM (4 OCPUs, 24 GB RAM). No credit card tricks — it's actually free.

```bash
# On your Oracle Ubuntu VM
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv
git clone https://github.com/trinathone/rezloft.git && cd rezloft
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium --with-deps

python3 setup.py        # configure once
# set HEADLESS = True in config.py
screen -S dicebot
python3 dice_bot.py
# Ctrl+A D to detach — bot keeps running
```

## How It Works

```
keywords.txt
    │
    ▼
Dice.com Search (Playwright + Chromium)
    │  per-keyword, paginated
    ▼
Easy Apply filter → parse job listings
    │  skip if URL already in applications.csv
    ▼
Multi-step form walk + Submit
    │
    ▼
applications.csv  ← timestamp, title, URL, status
    │
    ▼
Batch break → next keyword → sleep 2–3 AM → repeat
```

Anti-detection: Bezier mouse curves, human-speed typing, randomized viewport + user-agent, randomized delays, no screenshots, rotating logs.

## Known Limitations

- **Dice.com only.** No LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter — yet. (See Contributing.)
- **Easy Apply only.** External ATS (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever) are skipped.
- **Terms of Service.** Automated applications violate Dice's ToS. Use at your own risk.
- Company and location fields are blank in the CSV — Dice doesn't expose them on search result pages at this scale.
